<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body)</code>
  <pre>Create a map asset.

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Map is a collection of Layers, optionally contained within folders.
  "description": "A String", # The description of this Map, supplied by the author.
  "defaultViewport": [ # A rectangular geographic bounds. # An array of four numbers (west, south, east, north) which defines the rectangular bounding box of the default viewport. The numbers represent latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.
    3.14,
  ],
  "processingStatus": "A String", # The processing status of this map. Map processing is automatically started once a map becomes ready for processing.
  "draftAccessList": "A String", # Deprecated: The name of an access list of the Map Editor type. The user on whose behalf the request is being sent must be an editor on that access list. Note: Google Maps Engine no longer uses access lists. For backward compatibility, the API still accepts access lists for projects that are already using access lists. If you created a GME account/project after July 14th, 2014, you will not be able to send API requests that include access lists. The API does not yet support the new permissions model. When you create a map via the API without specifying permissions, the account that created the map is the owner and has effective administrator access. Users can then use the Maps Engine user interface to adjust the permissions. This is a temporary workaround until the API supports the new permissions model. Read Add new users and groups in the Google Maps Engine help center for more information.
  "projectId": "A String", # The ID of the project that this Map is in.
  "tags": [ # Tags of this Map.
    "A String",
  ],
  "creationTime": "A String", # The creation time of this map. The value is an RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (e.g. 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).
  "publishingStatus": "A String", # The publishing status of this map.
  "etag": "A String", # The ETag, used to refer to the current version of the asset.
  "bbox": [ # A rectangular bounding box which contains all of the data in this Map. The numbers represent latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.
    3.14,
  ],
  "versions": [ # Deprecated: An array containing the available versions of this Map. Currently may only contain "published". The publishingStatus field should be used instead.
    "published",
  ],
  "lastModifiedTime": "A String", # The last modified time of this map. The value is an RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (e.g. 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).
  "publishedAccessList": "A String", # Deprecated: The access list to whom view permissions are granted. The value must be the name of a Maps Engine access list of the Map Viewer type, and the user must be a viewer on that list. Read Share data, layers, and maps in the Google Maps Engine help center for more information.
  "id": "A String", # A globally unique ID, used to refer to this Map.
  "contents": [ # The contents of this Map.
    {
    },
