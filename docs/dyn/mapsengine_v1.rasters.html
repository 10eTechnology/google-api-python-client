<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(id)</code>
  <pre>Delete a raster.

Args:
  id: string, The ID of the raster. Only the raster creator or project owner are permitted to delete. If the raster is included in a layer or mosaic, the request will fail. Remove it from all parents prior to deleting. (required)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(id)</code>
  <pre>Return metadata for a single raster.

Args:
  id: string, The ID of the raster. (required)

Returns:
  An object of the form:
