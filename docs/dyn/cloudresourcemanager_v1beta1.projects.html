<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a project resource. Initially, the project resource is owned by its creator exclusively. The creator can later grant permission to others to read or update the project. Several APIs are activated automatically for the project, including Google Cloud Storage.

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Project is a high-level Google Cloud Platform entity. It is a container for ACLs, APIs, AppEngine Apps, VMs, and other Google Cloud Platform resources. Projects are subordinate to Customers.
  "name": "A String", # The user-assigned name of the project. This field is optional and can remain unset. Allowed characters are: lower- and upper-case letters, numbers, hyphen, single-quote, double-quotes, space, and exclamation point. Example: "My Project" Read-write.
  "projectId": "A String", # The unique, user-assigned id of the project. It must be 6 to 30 lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens. It must start with a letter. Trailing hyphens are prohibited. Example: "tokyo-rain-123" Read-only after creation.
  "labels": { # The labels associated with this project. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?. Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression ([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?. No more than 256 labels can be associated with a given resource. Note that additional character may be included in labels in the future. Clients should store labels in a representation such as JSON that does not depend on specific characters being disallowed. Example: "environment" : "dev" Read-write.
    "a_key": "A String",
  },
  "projectNumber": "A String", # The number uniquely identifying the project. Example: 415104041262. Read-only.

The fields eligible for filtering are: name id labels. where  is a the name of a label Examples: name:* ==> The project has a name. name:Howl ==> The project’s name is `Howl` or 'howl'. name:HOWL ==> Equivalent to above. NAME:howl ==> Equivalent to above. labels.color:* ==> The project has the label "color". labels.color:red ==> The project’s label `color` has the value `red`. labels.color:red label.size:big ==> The project's label `color` has the value `red` and its label `size` has the value `big`.

    "nextPageToken": "A String", # Pagination token. If the result set is too large to fit in a single response, this token is returned. It encodes the position of the current result cursor. Feeding this value into a new list request with the `page_token` parameter gives the next page of the results. When `next_page_token` is not filled in, there is no next page and the list returned is the last page in the result set. Pagination tokens have a limited lifetime.
